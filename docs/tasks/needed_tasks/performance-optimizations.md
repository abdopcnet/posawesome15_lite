- For API calls
- Ensure 1s idle time
- 🧠 Memory leak prevention in event listeners
- Memory leak prevention in timers

**🔧 Backend Optimizations**:

- 🗂️ Database indexing
- For frequently queried fields
- ⚡ Redis caching
- For session data
- Redis caching
- For frequently accessed data
- 🔗 Connection pooling optimization
- For MariaDB
- ⚡ Async processing
- For non-blocking operations
- 🔍 Query optimization
- With specific field selection
