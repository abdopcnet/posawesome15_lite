## üìñ Description

Improve POS Awesome calculations for **tax** and **totals** to align with ERPNext's original logic.
The current implementation may have discrepancies in how taxes and totals are calculated compared to ERPNext's standard behavior.

---

## üéØ Current Problem

POS Awesome uses custom calculation logic that may not match ERPNext's native calculations:

- Tax calculations may differ
- Total calculations may not align with ERPNext standard
- This can cause discrepancies when comparing with regular ERPNext invoices

---

## üéØ Required Task

**Improve calculations** to be aligned with ERPNext original logic:

### Tax Calculations

- Follow ERPNext's tax calculation logic
- Reference: `erpnext/erpnext/accounts/doctype/sales_invoice/sales_invoice.py`
- Ensure tax templates apply correctly
- Ensure tax rates calculate correctly
- Ensure tax amounts match ERPNext standard

### Total Calculations

- Follow ERPNext's total calculation sequence:
  1. Subtotal (sum of all item amounts)
  2. Discount Amount
  3. Net Total (Subtotal - Discount)
  4. Tax Amount
  5. Grand Total (Net Total + Tax)
- Reference: `erpnext/erpnext/accounts/doctype/sales_invoice/sales_invoice.js`
- Ensure all totals calculate exactly as ERPNext does

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### Backend Changes

- **File**: `posawesome/posawesome/api/sales_invoice.py`
- Update `create_and_submit_invoice()` method
- Follow ERPNext's `Sales Invoice` DocType calculations
- Ensure tax calculations use ERPNext standard methods
- Ensure total calculations follow ERPNext sequence

### Frontend Changes

- **File**: `posawesome/public/js/posapp/components/pos/Invoice.js`
- Update `calculateTotalsLocally()` method
- Ensure calculations match backend logic
- Remove any custom calculation logic
- Use only ERPNext standard formulas

---

## üìã Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze ERPNext Tax Calculation**
   - Study `erpnext/erpnext/accounts/doctype/sales_invoice/sales_invoice.py`
   - Understand how taxes are calculated
   - Document the calculation sequence

2. **Analyze ERPNext Total Calculation**
   - Study `erpnext/erpnext/accounts/doctype/sales_invoice/sales_invoice.js`
   - Understand total calculation sequence
   - Document all calculation steps

3. **Compare Current Implementation**
   - Compare POS Awesome calculations with ERPNext
   - Identify discrepancies
   - List all differences

4. **Implement Aligned Calculations**
   - Update backend tax calculation to match ERPNext
   - Update backend total calculation to match ERPNext
   - Update frontend calculations to match backend

5. **Test and Validate**
   - Create test invoices in POS
   - Create same invoices in ERPNext standard UI
   - Compare tax amounts
   - Compare total amounts
   - Ensure 100% match

## üìä Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Tax calculations** match ERPNext exactly
‚úÖ **Total calculations** match ERPNext exactly
‚úÖ No discrepancies between POS invoices and standard ERPNext invoices
‚úÖ All calculation formulas follow ERPNext native logic
‚úÖ No custom calculation logic remains

## üìñ References

- ERPNext Sales Invoice Calculation: `erpnext/erpnext/accounts/doctype/sales_invoice/`
- Current POS Implementation: `posawesome/public/js/posapp/components/pos/Invoice.js`
- Backend API: `posawesome/posawesome/api/sales_invoice.py`

---

## üí° Key Principle

**Use ERPNext's native calculation methods. Do not reinvent the wheel.**

All calculations must follow ERPNext's standard logic to ensure consistency across the entire system.
